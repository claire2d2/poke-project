# Pokémon : gotta cache them all!

This project was co-developed by Claire, Ivan and Raphaël during the 262 Ironhack WebDev Cohort using :

- Typescript
- Tailwind
- My JSON Server for our own backend (repo [here](https://github.com/smnraphael/poke-backend), fake online REST [here](https://poke-backend.adaptable.app/))

Most of the data and images are sourced directly from the [pokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/)

The project is available [here](https://cache-them-all.netlify.app/)

## Features(v1):

- Listing all the first 3 generations of pokémon (Bulbasaur to Deoxys)
- Favoriting and unfavoriting pokémon
- Filtering and sorting the list of pokémon by name, generation, color, height, weight, favorites
- Creating and editing your own pokémon team(s)
- Taking a snap of your pokémon team(s) with a chosen trainer, team and background
- A quiz to test your knowledge on pokémon (training mode and test mode)
- Basic mobile responsiveness and dark mode that follows user system settings

## Next steps :

- [x] Dark mode
- [ ] Possibility for users to log in
