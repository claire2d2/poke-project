            This website is for all the Pok√©mon lovers, the eternal children
            filled with nostalgia and remembering fondly their hours spent
            playing on a poorly lit device, capturing small pixelated pocket
            monsters...

            Take a trip down memory lane with us! Search and sort through the
            first 3 generations of pokemon. That's 386 pokemon in total, from
            Bulbasaur to Deoxys! And of course, Pikachu's in the lot.
